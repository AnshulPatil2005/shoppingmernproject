### Setup .env file to connect with your database
 make a .env file that connects your program with the data base 
```shell
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
PORT=5000
```

### How to run the app

```shell
npm run build
```
Start the app
```shell
npm run start
```

### This app uses node.js version 2.2.12 so it is recommended to use this info while using the cluster on mongoose

### use npm install @2.2.12 -->this install the mongoose driver of version of node.js

### run npm install -g win-node-env -->this command makes sure the programme runs on windows 

### dont use special characters in the username or password of the cluster as it causes error when posting the link in the dotenv file
